# Welcome!

**Warning: Long post ahead**

Welcome to ISCS 30.28 aka CICD. In this course, you will implement an Continuous Integration and Deployment Pipeline.

If you have trouble accessing the syllabus on AISIS, it is also accessible through this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cQjcaqTV8f8aXcFX0R3a295ilhLSORJtU8ykMrU5C9I/edit?usp=sharing): 

# Prerequisites
You need to have an application to deploy.

# Proper Netiquette

The syllabus contains some basic rules and regulations. Here are more detailed rules specific to my class:

1. **Cyberbullying/online harassment will not be tolerated.** This includes but is not limited to, pestering others for their code, providing malware-infected files, or posting any inappropriate material on official class pages. **A violation of this policy will incur a *minimum* penalty of having a grade of 0 for the entire course.**
2. **Do not share links outside this class.** This pertains mainly to the links we will use for synchronous sessions, but also includes links to exercises, lab solutions, etc. There have already been incidents in the past where classes have been zoom-bombed, so please again, DO NOT SHARE LINKS.
3. **Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.** I reply fastest via chat, but email is also okay. You can also ask questions anonymously via the AnonymityBot.

**P.S.** I *detest* it when students message or email with just "Can I ask a question?" and then wait for me to say yes.  This is what happens when you do that

Student: "Can I ask a question?"

Me three hours later when I have time: "Sure"

Student three hours later: "Sir, I have a problem with my x and y and z"

Me three hours later: "Ok this is how you fix it"

**JUST. ASK. YOUR. QUESTION.** You can say you have a question, then follow it with your question, but you don't need my permission to ask.

# Participation

## Consultation Sessions
Note that **students are expected to schedule a consultation bi-weekly** to provide a status report on their progress. You may of course consult more frequently if slots are available.

## Groups
You are to make groups of four for the class. To make groups on Canvas, see the following [resource](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-join-a-group-as-a-student/ta-p/468). All submissions will be done by group. In the peer evaluation, **your grade will be scaled depending on your group's feedback.**

# Tips for this Class

1. If you are a first-time online learner, you may want to set up some **routines** for yourself. When do you plan to go through the course?  The worst possible answer is: "Whenever I feel like it!"

This is a Guided Studies class which is very hands-off. **You are expected to do independent research** to complete your projects. At the same time, I am available via Google Chat to answer questions if you are having a difficult time.

2. **Learn to read documentation.**

![Read the docs](https://i.redd.it/2z08tsdqms011.jpg)

Stackoverflow, Reddit, and your classmates' code may all be sources of information, but nothing beats reading the documentation. A lot of the topics needed to complete the project will be new, not only to students, but even to people in the industry. Our single source of truth and primary source will be the official documentation.

# Read the Readme Assignment

If you haven't noticed, there is a Read the Readme Assignment posted on Canvas. To complete that assignment, complete all the instructions in this Readme, **answer the course survey on canvas**, and submit the word "Yes" in the assignment.

Congratulations! You've read your first Readme for this class!
