# Welcome!

**Warning: Long post ahead**

Welcome to MSYS 180.03/CSCI 284.13 aka Cloud Computing. In this course, you will explore different database technologies built for different purposes and use cases. The syllabus for the course should appear below.

If you have trouble accessing the syllabus on AISIS, it is also accessible through this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ka81jHuAXmhpANwQOyphq1soBZqqEQJT1WmJFkMBMU): 

# Prerequisites
Ideally, MIS 101, Information Systems Administration, Computer Architecture, and Operating Systems, but not necessary. 

# Proper Netiquette

The syllabus contains some basic rules and regulations. Here are more detailed rules specific to my class:

1. **Cyberbullying/online harassment will not be tolerated.** This includes but is not limited to, pestering others for their code, providing malware-infected files, or posting any inappropriate material on official class pages. **A violation of this policy will incur a *minimum* penalty of having a grade of 0 for the entire course.**
2. **Do not share links outside this class.** This pertains mainly to the links we will use for synchronous sessions, but also includes links to exercises, lab solutions, etc. There have already been incidents in the past where classes have been zoom-bombed, so please again, DO NOT SHARE LINKS.
3. **Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.** I reply fastest via [chat](https://chat.google.com/), but email is also okay. You can also ask questions anonymously via the AnonymityBot.

**P.S.** I *detest* it when students message or email with just "Can I ask a question?" and then wait for me to say yes.  This is what happens when you do that

Student: "Can I ask a question?"

Me three hours later when I have time: "Sure"

Student three hours later: "Sir, I have a problem with my x and y and z"

Me three hours later: "Ok this is how you fix it"

**JUST. ASK. YOUR. QUESTION.** You can say you have a question, then follow it with your question, but you don't need my permission to ask.

# Participation

## Synchronous Sessions
Note that **majority of the class will be asynchronous**. Synchronous sessions will be there mainly to clarify instructions, address common questions, and challenging topics and demonstrations. Sixty minutes are allotted for synchronous sessions on average, but it may take longer depending on the topic.

Officially, synchronous sessions should be held according to the AISIS official schedule. 

## Labs
There will be two types of labs that you will see in the course: Guided Labs and Graded/Challenge Labs. The Guided Labs contribute to your participation grade and to earning the course badges. They may be submitted as many times as needed. The Challenge Labs contribute to your lab grade **and may only be submitted once per person.** On Canvas, Guided Labs are links while the Graded Labs are assignments.

## Badges
![Collect them all](https://miro.medium.com/max/1307/0*dJDQTI7yUCDStfIX)

Your participation for the class will be measured in the form of badges. There are two badges you can earn in your class. These badges are issued by the [Acclaim Platform](https://www.youracclaim.com/), an industry recognized system which can even be shared on LinkedIn. This is an example of the badge you receive:

<div data-iframe-width="150" data-iframe-height="270" data-share-badge-id="e42ffbbc-887d-4f0c-8bbd-0d30e226298d" data-share-badge-host="https://www.youracclaim.com"></div><script type="text/javascript" async src="//cdn.youracclaim.com/assets/utilities/embed.js"></script>

You can click the badge to view more details.

You can get a **maximum** of 20 points corresponding to a full 20% participation grade. The Cloud Foundations Badge earns you 7.50% while the Cloud Architecting Badge is worth 12.50%. If you are unable to achieve the badges, your participation grade will be based on the Cloud Foundations and Cloud Architecting Knowledge Checks, as well as the Cloud Architecting Guided Labs.

## PLP
Portable learning packets are available **upon request**. Email me your concern, and I will work with the SOSE team to provide you with the material that you need.

## The Beadle
The beadle will be given special participation grades. They will **not be required** (but still encouraged) to earn the Cloud Practitioner Badge. At the same time, the beadle will have their own tasks which will be the basis for 7.50 participation grade.

### Beadle Requirements
1. The beadle must have a stable internet connection.
2. The beadle must have a computer.
3. The beadle must have a good relationship with the people in the class.

### Beadle Responsibilities
1. **Document synchronous sessions**. The beadle must write minutes of the sync session, then send to the rest of the class via chat (hence requirements 1 and 3).
2. Unfortunately, as a teacher, there are some things I cannot demonstrate because I lack a student account. The beadle is then responsible for **some content creation** to demonstrate some activities for the class. This will definitely NOT be a regular occurrence and may not even happen for this class.
3. The beadle **MUST** be present in **ALL SYNCHRONOUS** activities. This includes **BOTH** synchronous classes and synchronous consultations (as needed). This is to comply with LS guidelines that all synchronous sessions must consist of at least three people.
4. The beadle is to act as a **bridge between teacher and student**. If there is something students cannot or will not ask the teacher directly, they may do so through the beadle. As such, the beadle must also know how to keep their mouth shut and respect the privacy of their fellow student.

Much trust and responsibility will be given to the beadle, at the same time, know that the recognition will be commensurate.

# Tips for this Class

1. If you are a first-time online learner, you may want to set up some **routines** for yourself. When do you plan to go through the course?  The worst possible answer is: "Whenever I feel like it!"

Online courses require a regular schedule, so set specific and regular days and times for yourself. If you use an online tool like Google Calendar, it may help to schedule your course learning time there.

For example: Every Monday from 8 am to 12 pmâ€”or every Tuesday from 9 to 11 am and from  2 to 4 pm. 

I suggest allotting two hours regularly. Every module is estimated to entail about 6 to 10 hours of work (that's about one entire day!). If you allot at least two half days every week, you should be able to complete the course in three to six weeks.

2. **Learn to read documentation.**

![Read the docs](https://i.redd.it/2z08tsdqms011.jpg)

Stackoverflow, Reddit, and your classmates' code may all be sources of information, but nothing beats reading the documentation. A lot of the topics we will be covering will be new, not only to students, but even to people in the industry. Our single source of truth and primary source will be the official documentation.

# Read the Readme Assignment

If you haven't noticed, there is a Read the Readme Assignment posted on Canvas. To complete that assignment, complete all the instructions in this Readme, and submit the word "Yes" in the assignment.

Congratulations! You've read your first Readme for this class!
