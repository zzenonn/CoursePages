# Welcome!

**Warning: Long post ahead**

Welcome to ISCS 30.23 aka Containerizing Applications. In this course, build (possibly) your first containerized application.

If you have trouble accessing the syllabus on AISIS, it is also accessible through this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K342LcLBIHb7U-8tyJ1DZ-4ueAZyeTXcUOg89Asp76U/): 

# Prerequisites
You should know how to write a web application. Even just an HTML page.

# Proper Netiquette

The syllabus contains some basic rules and regulations. Here are more detailed rules specific to my class:

1. **Cyberbullying/online harassment will not be tolerated.** This includes but is not limited to, pestering others for their code, providing malware-infected files, or posting any inappropriate material on official class pages. **A violation of this policy will incur a *minimum* penalty of having a grade of 0 for the entire course.**
2. **Do not share links outside this class.** This pertains mainly to the links we will use for synchronous sessions, but also includes links to exercises, lab solutions, etc. There have already been incidents in the past where classes have been zoom-bombed, so please again, DO NOT SHARE LINKS.
3. **Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.** I reply fastest via chat, but email is also okay. You can also ask questions anonymously via the AnonymityBot.

**P.S.** I *detest* it when students message or email with just "Can I ask a question?" and then wait for me to say yes.  This is what happens when you do that

Student: "Can I ask a question?"

Me three hours later when I have time: "Sure"

Student three hours later: "Sir, I have a problem with my x and y and z"

Me three hours later: "Ok this is how you fix it"

**JUST. ASK. YOUR. QUESTION.** You can say you have a question, then follow it with your question, but you don't need my permission to ask.

# Participation

## Synchronous Sessions
Note that **majority of the class will be asynchronous**. Synchronous sessions will be there mainly to clarify instructions, address common questions, and tackle challenging topics and demonstrations. Fifteen minutes are allotted for synchronous sessions on average, but it may take longer upon the request of the group.

Be sure to fill-up the when2meet posted on canvas to determine your schedule.

## Groups
You are to make groups of four for the class. To make groups on Canvas, see the following [resource](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-create-a-group-as-a-student/ta-p/280). All submissions will be done by group. In the peer evaluation, **your grade will be scaled depending on your group's feedback.**

## PLP
Portable learning packets are available **upon request**. Email me your concern, and I will work with the SOSE team to provide you with the material that you need.

# Tips for this Class

1. If you are a first-time online learner, you may want to set up some **routines** for yourself. When do you plan to go through the course?  The worst possible answer is: "Whenever I feel like it!"

This is a Guided Studies class which is very hands-off. **You are expected to do independent research** to complete your projects. At the same time, I am available via Google Chat to answer questions if you are having a difficult time.

2. **Learn to read documentation.**

![Read the docs](https://i.redd.it/2z08tsdqms011.jpg)

Stackoverflow, Reddit, and your classmates' code may all be sources of information, but nothing beats reading the documentation. A lot of the topics needed to complete the project will be new, not only to students, but even to people in the industry. Our single source of truth and primary source will be the official documentation.

# Read the Readme Assignment

If you haven't noticed, there is a Read the Readme Assignment posted on Canvas. To complete that assignment, complete all the instructions in this Readme, **answer the course survey on canvas**, and submit the word "Yes" in the assignment.

Congratulations! You've read your first Readme for this class!
